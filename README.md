## üß† Introduction

**Graph-RAG-AI-Bot** is an innovative AI assistant that allows users to interact with any website through natural language conversations. Instead of manually reading through extensive web content, users can simply input a website URL, and the bot will provide concise, accurate answers to their queries by leveraging advanced AI techniques.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Web Scraping**: Automatically extracts content from any given website URL.
* **Markdown Conversion**: Converts scraped HTML content into structured Markdown format while preserving the original layout.
* **Logical Chunking**: Breaks down content into meaningful sections for efficient processing.
* **Knowledge Graph Storage**: Stores content chunks in a Neo4j graph database, capturing relationships between different sections.
* **Semantic Search**: Retrieves relevant content chunks based on user queries.
* **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Groq's LLaMA 3.3 model to generate accurate and context-aware responses.
* **Interactive Chat Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interactions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

1. **Input**: User provides a website URL.
2. **Scraping**: The `web_scraper.py` module uses BeautifulSoup to extract HTML content.
3. **Conversion**: HTML content is converted to Markdown format, preserving structure.
4. **Chunking**: The `text_chunker.py` module divides the content into logical chunks.
5. **Graph Storage**: Chunks are stored in Neo4j using the `neo4j_manager.py` module, establishing relationships between them.
6. **Query Processing**: User queries are processed, and relevant chunks are retrieved from the graph database.
7. **Response Generation**: The `llm_client.py` module sends the retrieved information to the LLaMA 3.3 model via Groq's API to generate responses.
8. **Output**: The generated response is presented to the user through the chat interface.([arxiv.org][2])
